<h1><strong> Victor Vandenbroek, assignment 03, basic HTML </strong></h1>
<p><strong>My name is Victor and I have many interests, for example, I love to play soccer, paint, and cook. I play center mid and have been playing ever since I was three years old. I started playing when I was in Sarasota Florida and played for the angel fish with a bunch of my neighbors and friends. I loved the sport and decided to keep playing and played all throughout high school and now in college. My favorite team is west ham which is an English team who are based in London. My favorite international teams are France and Netherlands because my dad is dutch and my mom is French. I also enjoy painting album covers and painting overall because it is very relaxing. Cooking is also one of my favorite things to do and I like to cook pasta, chicken, and Caesar salads. </strong></p>

<h2> <em> My Goals </em> </h2>
<p> <em> Even though I am still young in the world I have many goals I would love to complete before I am dead. <u>First of all</u>, I want to get my master's in health administration at a great university. I want to spend more time with my family as I am growing older very quickly and want to spend quality time with them. My next big goal is to of course have a family and be able to support them finically and emotionally. I want to be heavily involved in my children's lives and not have work interfere with my relationship with them. I get a lot of my inspiration from my parents because of how they raised me and my brother and sister. They would put us first and sacrifice a lot for us and I would love to do the same things for my kids. I want them to have a better life growing up than I did and make sure they are loved and cared for emotionally and psychically.</em> </p>
